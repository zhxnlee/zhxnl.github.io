        Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body, and other terms used are <b>malignant tumours and neoplams.</b>  In this page, we will be exploring more about the percentage of Cancer globally, the death rate of Cancer, the most prominent Cancer type and the main causes of the most prominent Cancer type.

        <h1>What is the rank of Cancer in causes of deaths?</h1>
        <p>
          Figure 1 shows a <b>lollipop chart</b> that represents the Cause of Deaths from various diseases throughout the years. 
          The x-axis represents the <b>total number of deaths</b> from each disease, and the y-axis represents the <b>cause of deaths</b> showing all the important diseases. A <b>selection filter "Continent"</b> can be used to filter the lollipop chart based on the desired continent, and a <b>slider filter</b> can be used to visualise the changes of the cause of deaths from each disease throughout the years.
          
          <br>
          <br>
           According to the World Health Organization (2022) and the lollipop chart on the left taken from Our World in Data (Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie, 2015), Cancer is the <b>second leading cause of death globally</b>, accounting for an estimated <b>10 million deaths
          in 2019</b>. The number of deaths for Cancer continues to grow from the year 1990 of about 5 million deaths to the year 2019 of about 10 milion deaths as we apply the slider filter. This is almost <b>twice as much deaths</b> in Cancer alone in 29 years of time!
          <br>
          <br>
          In this page, we will be finding out more on the types of cancers, how much does it affect the global population, and its related causes.

        <p>
          According to the "Prevalance of Cancer Globally" <b>choropleth map</b> above taken by Our World in Data (Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie, 2015), <b>Russia seems to have the highest share of Cancer</b> from 1990 to 2019 of about <b>14% of the global Cancer population</b>.
          However, according to Figure 3 choropleth map showing the <b>death rate of Cancer per 100,000 people</b> taken from 
          <b>Our World in Data</b> (Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie, 2015), and according to the statistics from <b>World Cancer Research Fund National</b> (n.d.), <b>Mongolia</b> seems to suffer the <b>most death rate from Cancer</b> from 1990 to 2019 of about <b>300 deaths per 100,000 people</b>.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Other than that, as we apply the "Year" filter from 1990 to 2019 to Figure 3 choropleth map showing the death rate from Cancer, we can see that the <b>overall death rate from Cancer decreases</b> as the colour saturation of major parts of the map is decreasing.

          Figure 4 shows a <b>lollipop chart</b> that represents the <b>number of deaths for each cancer type</b> over the years. The x-axis represents the <b>total number of deaths for each Cancer Type</b> in a particular year, while the y-axis represents <b>all the Cancer Types</b>. A <b>filter slider</b> can be used to visualise how the number of deaths for each Cancer Type changes, and a <b>selection tool</b> can be used to select the continents. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the years, <b>"Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer"</b> seems to dominate the chart with the <b>most cancer number of deaths</b>, which is followed by <b>"Stomach cancer" and "Colon and rectum cancer".</b>
              </p>
          <br>
         
          <p>The number of deaths for most of cancer types <b>increases from the year 1990 to 2019</b> as we apply the slider filter.</p>

          Figure 5 shows a <b>line chart</b> that helps further visualise the <b>trend of the death rate</b> for each of the Cancer types. The x-axis represents the <b>years</b>, and the y-axis represents the <b>total number of deaths</b> for each Cancer type.
          <br>
          <br>
          As the smaller values for the line chart seems too clustered to visualise, a <b>selection filter</b> is added with the selection "less than 1,600,000" and "less than 180,000" to help the viewers visualise all the other smaller values of cancer type deaths that are below 1,600,000 and 180,000 clearly. 
          <br>
          <br>
          As we apply the <b>"Smaller values" filter</b>, we can also see that most of the <b>other cancer type deaths are also increasing slowly</b> from year 1990 to 2019, but it is not as significant compared to the "Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer" deaths.

        <h1>What are the Risk Factors for Lung Cancer deaths?</h1>
        <p>
          As we have seen above that the number of deaths from <b>"Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer"</b> is the <b>highest among deaths of other cancer types</b>, we now dive deeper into the <b>risk factors of Lung Cancer</b>.
          According to the <b>National Library of Medicine</b> of an article "Smoking and Lung Cancer" (Walser, T. et al, 2008), it is estimated that <b>cigerette smoking explains almost 90% of lung cancer risk in men and 70% to 80% in women.</b>
          It is stated that the <b>smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer</b> and the data supporting this relationship by Walser, T. et al (2018) are compelling.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Figure 6 on the left shows the <b>different risk factors that causes lung cancer deaths</b>. The x-axis represents the <b>total number of deaths for each risk factors</b>, and the y-axis represents the <b>different risk factors throughout the years for a particular gender</b>. The year can be filtered by using the <b>"Year" filter slider</b>, and the Gender can be selected by using the <b>selection filter on "Gender"</b>
            Figure 6 shows that the top risk factors (excluding behavioural, environmental risks) are <b>Tobacco and Smoking</b>, with a higher difference in values between them and the other values in Male, compared to Female.

        <h1>Brief insight on Smoking</h1>
        <p>
          As we have seen from above that the risk factor for most deaths of Lung Cancer are from Tobacco and Smoking. We will now have a brief look at the <b>death rate for Smoking</b>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Figure 7 shows a <b>choropleth map of the death rate of smoking per 100,000 people throughout the years</b>. A <b>slider filter for the year</b> can be used to visualise the deathrate globally from the year 1990 to 2019. The choropleth map <b>can also be filtered based on the highest global percentage</b> of a country with the highest death rate of smoking, and continents can also be chosen from the selection filter. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Based on Figure 7, it seems that <b>Greenland and Myanmar</b> has the <b>highest percentage of Smoking</b> compared to the other countries.
            As we apply the Year filter from 1990 to 2019, it is obvious that the <b>death rate for Smoking has significantly decreased</b> all around the world, where the saturation of the choropleth map decreases to a lower color value.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Cancer is the second leading deaths globally, with Lung Cancer topping the charts of the number of deaths for all cancer types, and Tobacco and Smoking is one of the highest leading factors to lung cancer.
